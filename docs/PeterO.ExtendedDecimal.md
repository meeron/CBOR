## PeterO.ExtendedDecimal

    public sealed class ExtendedDecimal :
        System.IComparable,
        System.IEquatable

<b>Deprecated.</b> Use EDecimal from PeterO.Numbers/com.upokecenter.numbers and the output of this class's ToString method.

<b>This class is largely obsolete. It will be replaced by a new version of this class in a different namespace/package and library, called  `PeterO.Numbers.EDecimal`  in the<a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/PeterO.Numbers"> `PeterO.Numbers` </a>library (in .NET), or  `com.upokecenter.numbers.EDecimal`  in the<a href="https://github.com/peteroupc/numbers-java"> `com.github.peteroupc/numbers` </a>artifact (in Java). This new class can be used in the `CBORObject.FromObject(object)`  method (by including the new library in your code, among other things).</b>

 Represents an arbitrary-precision decimal floating-point number.<b>About decimal arithmetic</b>

Decimal (base-10) arithmetic, such as that provided by this class, is appropriate for calculations involving such real-world data as prices and other sums of money, tax rates, and measurements. These calculations often involve multiplying or dividing one decimal with another decimal, or performing other operations on decimal numbers. Many of these calculations also rely on rounding behavior in which the result after rounding is a decimal number (for example, multiplying a price by a premium rate, then rounding, should result in a decimal amount of money).

On the other hand, most implementations of  `float`  and `double` , including in C# and Java, store numbers in a binary (base-2) floating-point format and use binary floating-point arithmetic. Many decimal numbers can't be represented exactly in binary floating-point format (regardless of its length). Applying binary arithmetic to numbers intended to be decimals can sometimes lead to unintuitive results, as is shown in the description for the FromDouble() method of this class.

<b>About ExtendedDecimal instances</b>

Each instance of this class consists of an integer mantissa and an integer exponent, both arbitrary-precision. The value of the number equals mantissa * 10^exponent.

The mantissa is the value of the digits that make up a number, ignoring the decimal point and exponent. For example, in the number 2356.78, the mantissa is 235678. The exponent is where the "floating" decimal point of the number is located. A positive exponent means "move it to the right", and a negative exponent means "move it to the left." In the example 2, 356.78, the exponent is -2, since it has 2 decimal places and the decimal point is "moved to the left by 2." Therefore, in the arbitrary-precision decimal representation, this number would be stored as 235678 * 10^-2.

The mantissa and exponent format preserves trailing zeros in the number's value. This may give rise to multiple ways to store the same value. For example, 1.00 and 1 would be stored differently, even though they have the same value. In the first case, 100 * 10^-2 (100 with decimal point moved left by 2), and in the second case, 1 * 10^0 (1 with decimal point moved 0).

This class also supports values for negative zero, not-a-number (NaN) values, and infinity. <b>Negative zero</b> is generally used when a negative number is rounded to 0; it has the same mathematical value as positive zero. <b>Infinity</b> is generally used when a non-zero number is divided by zero, or when a very high number can't be represented in a given exponent range.<b>Not-a-number</b> is generally used to signal errors.

This class implements the General Decimal Arithmetic Specification version 1.70 (except part of chapter 6): `http://speleotrove.com/decimal/decarith.html`

<b>Errors and Exceptions</b>

Passing a signaling NaN to any arithmetic operation shown here will signal the flag FlagInvalid and return a quiet NaN, even if another operand to that operation is a quiet NaN, unless noted otherwise.

Passing a quiet NaN to any arithmetic operation shown here will return a quiet NaN, unless noted otherwise. Invalid operations will also return a quiet NaN, as stated in the individual methods.

Unless noted otherwise, passing a null arbitrary-precision decimal argument to any method here will throw an exception.

When an arithmetic operation signals the flag FlagInvalid, FlagOverflow, or FlagDivideByZero, it will not throw an exception too, unless the flag's trap is enabled in the precision context (see EContext's Traps property).

If an operation requires creating an intermediate value that might be too big to fit in memory (or might require more than 2 gigabytes of memory to store -- due to the current use of a 32-bit integer internally as a length), the operation may signal an invalid-operation flag and return not-a-number (NaN). In certain rare cases, the CompareTo method may throw OutOfMemoryException (called OutOfMemoryError in Java) in the same circumstances.

<b>Serialization</b>

An arbitrary-precision decimal value can be serialized (converted to a stable format) in one of the following ways:

 * By calling the toString() method, which will always return distinct strings for distinct arbitrary-precision decimal values.

 * By calling the UnsignedMantissa, Exponent, and IsNegative properties, and calling the IsInfinity, IsQuietNaN, and IsSignalingNaN methods. The return values combined will uniquely identify a particular arbitrary-precision decimal value.

<b>Thread safety</b>

Instances of this class are immutable, so they are inherently safe for use by multiple threads. Multiple instances of this object with the same properties are interchangeable, so they should not be compared using the "==" operator (which might only check if each side of the operator is the same instance).

<b>Comparison considerations</b>

This class's natural ordering (under the CompareTo method) is not consistent with the Equals method. This means that two values that compare as equal under the CompareTo method might not be equal under the Equals method. The CompareTo method compares the mathematical values of the two instances passed to it (and considers two different NaN values as equal), while two instances with the same mathematical value, but different exponents, will be considered unequal under the Equals method.
